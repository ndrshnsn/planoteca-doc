This is a [starter template](https://vsoch.github.com/tw-jekyll/) for a Tailwind jekyll theme, based
on [these docs](https://github.com/superfly/docs) that are based on [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation),
however everything has been modified to work on GitHub pages (using Jekyll). If you don't need
native deployment on GitHub pages, then please consider checking out Tailwind. 
The original [Apache License](https://github.com/vsoch/tw-jekyll/tree/main/LICENSE) is included.

See the [respository]({{ site.repo }}) for more details.
